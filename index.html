                <h2 class="color-headline">The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American Musical Fantasy Film</h2>
                <p>When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, Toto, are whisked away in their house to the magical land of Oz. They follow the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to meet the Wizard, and en route they meet a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) that needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley) missing a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. The wizard asks the group to bring him the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) to earn his help.

                <article> 

                    <h3>There were actually two Wizard of Oz movies</h3>
                    <p>The first was a 1925 silent film, which, puzzlingly, had no magic. You might recognize one of its actors: the Tin Man was played by Oliver Hardy of Laurel and Hardy fame. <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/wizard-of-oz-facts/" class="news-articles" target="_blank">Read More...</a>

                    <h3>The Scarecrow was originally cast as the Tin Man</h3>
                    <p>However, since Ray Bolger preferred to be the Scarecrow — he felt the character’s style would showcase his physicality and dancing ability — he was allowed to switch. <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/wizard-of-oz-facts/" class="news-articles" target="_blank">Read More...</a>

                    <h3>Dorothy was originally envisioned to be a blonde</h3>
                    <p>Judy Garland wore a wig for the first two weeks of filming until studio execs changed their minds. Then, she was given a henna rinse and wore a partial wig to lengthen her hair. <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/wizard-of-oz-facts/" class="news-articles" target="_blank">Read More...</a>

                    <h3>Judy Garland was 16 during the making of Oz</h3>
                    <p>In the book, author L. Frank Baum did not provide an age for Dorothy, but in the illustrations, she is clearly a child. As a result, Garland had to wear a corset for the film so she’d appear as young and flat-chested as possible. <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/wizard-of-oz-facts/" class="news-articles" target="_blank">Read More...</a>

                    <h3>The close relationships among the cast even off screen</h3>
                    <p>Judy Garland’s daughter Liza Minnelli married Jack Haley Jr, the Tin Man’s son. And, at the memorial service for Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch), Ray Bolger (Scarecrow) gave the eulogy. <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/wizard-of-oz-facts/" class="news-articles" target="_blank">Read More...</a>

                    <h3>The role of Toto was played by a 5 yr old female Cairn terrier</h3>
                    <p>She was owned by Carl Spitz, who trained military and police dogs in Germany in WWI before he emigrated to America and opened Hollywood Dog Training School. He helped innovate the use of silent hand signals to command dogs. <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/wizard-of-oz-facts/" class="news-articles" target="_blank">Read More...</a>
